## Installation

```bash
pip install bt-auto-dumper
```

## Usage


```bash
bt-auto-dumper --help
```

This project uses [ApiVer](https://github.com/reef-technologies/apiver):
* when using `bt-auto-dumper` as a command line tool, in context of script, make sure you explicitly set `BT_AUTO_DUMPER_APIVER=v1` env variable to ensure compatibility with future versions
* when python package itself make sure to import `bt_auto_dumper.v1`

## Versioning

This package uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
TL;DR you are safe to use [compatible release version specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#compatible-release) `~=MAJOR.MINOR` in your `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.

Additionally, this package uses [ApiVer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgcoAKchPjk) to further reduce the risk of breaking changes.
This means, the public API of this package is explicitly versioned, e.g. `bt_auto_dumper.v1`, and will not change in a backwards-incompatible way even when `bt_auto_dumper.v2` is released.

Internal packages, i.e. prefixed by `bt_auto_dumper._` do not share these guarantees and may change in a backwards-incompatible way at any time even in patch releases.


## Development


Pre-requisites:
- [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


Ideally, you should run `nox -t format lint` before every commit to ensure that the code is properly formatted and linted.
Before submitting a PR, make sure that tests pass as well, you can do so using:
```
nox -t check # equivalent to `nox -t format lint test`
```

If you wish to install dependencies into `.venv` so your IDE can pick them up, you can do so using:
```
pdm install --dev
```

### Release process

Run `nox -s make_release -- X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the version you're releasing and follow the printed instructions.
